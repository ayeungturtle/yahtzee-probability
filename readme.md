# Yahtzee Probability

I got curious about the probability of rolling a Yahtzee....According to https://www.thoughtco.com/probability-of-rolling-a-yahtzee-3126593, is about 4.74%.  I want to see if I can get in that ballpark with a model.  Also - I haven't written code in a while, so this'll be good practice.
